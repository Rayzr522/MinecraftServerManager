# MinecraftServerManager
A simple server manager script for Minecraft.

### Use
`mcsm <start|stop|restart|cmd <command>|console|config>`

start: Starts the server

stop: Stops the server

restart: Stops and then starts the server

cmd: Executes a server command

console: Opens the server console

config: Opens the config file

### Installation
Put mcsm into a folder that's part of your path, or at least put it somewhere memorable. Run `mcsm` once (just by itself, no sub-commands), and it'll generate a config file. After that run `mcsm config` to edit the config and put in the information as needed.
